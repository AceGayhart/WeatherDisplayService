# WeatherDisplayService

This is the backend service for my [Weather Display](https://github.com/AceGayhart/weather-display)
project. I needed a quick and dirty service just so I could publish the front end without exposing
API keys. Of course, since the intent is to just have this deployed locally, this meager project is
likely overkill.
